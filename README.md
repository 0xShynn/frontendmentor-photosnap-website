## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [GraphCMS](http://graphcms.com) - Headless CMS
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Cloud platform for serverless deployment
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) - UI framework
- [Sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) - For the responsive web design

### Continued development

For this project I wanted to try GraphCMS as a headless CMS to integrate content (text, images, icons, logos etc). It took me more time to finish the challenge but I learned a lot about how to structure the content, build the graphql queries and use the data during the development part. It was a good experience and I'm planning to keep learning about the JAMstack and headless CMS.

### Useful resources

- [https://boredhumans.com/faces](https://boredhumans.com/faces.php) - A tool to generate fake humans avatar images. I end up not using but it's still something that can be handy for future projects
